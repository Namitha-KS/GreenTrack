
## A Brief of the Prototype:
This project involves the development of a web-based Proximity Score Calculator that evaluates the accessibility of various essential services and amenities from a user-specified location. The tool is designed based on the Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment (GRIHA) guidelines, which emphasize sustainable and convenient urban planning. Leveraging the Google Maps API, the tool computes proximity scores for a range of locations, aiding users in making informed decisions about their residential or business locations based on convenience, accessibility, and sustainability. The tool calculates the distance from the user's location to the nearest essential services:

1) Hospitals
2) Shopping Malls
3) Train Stations
4) Taxi Stands
5) Subway Stations
6) Movie Theatres
7) Pharmacies
8) Doctors and Physiotherapists
9) Veterinary Care
10) Religious Places
11) Restaurants and Cafes
12) Government Buildings such as Police Stations, City Halls, Fire Stations, Post Office, etc.. 
13) Schools and Universities 
14) Banks and ATMs
15) Art Gallery
16) Parks and Gyms
